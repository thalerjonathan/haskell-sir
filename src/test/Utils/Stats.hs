-- EXPLANATION OF t-test
-- There are two kinds of hypotheses for a one sample t-test, the null hypothesis 
-- and the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis assumes that some 
-- difference exists between the true mean (μ) and the comparison value (m0), 
-- whereas the null hypothesis assumes that no difference exists. 
-- The purpose of the one sample t-test is to determine if the null hypothesis 
-- should be rejected, given the sample data. The alternative hypothesis can
-- assume one of three forms depending on the question being asked. If the goal 
-- is to measure any difference, regardless of direction, a two-tailed hypothesis 
-- is used. 

-- The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that the difference between the true mean 
-- (μ) and the comparison value (m0) is equal to zero.

-- The two-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that the difference between 
-- the true mean (μ) and the comparison value (m0) is not equal to zero.

-- The upper-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that the true mean (μ) 
-- of the sample is greater than the comparison value (m0).

-- The lower-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that the true mean (μ)
-- of the sample is less than the comparison value (m0).

-- The p-value gives the probability of observing the test results under the 
-- null hypothesis. The lower the p-value, the lower the probability of 
-- obtaining a result like the one that was observed if the null hypothesis 
-- was true. Thus, a low p-value indicates decreased support for the null hypothesis. 
-- However, the possibility that the null hypothesis is true and that we simply
-- obtained a very rare result can never be ruled out completely. The cutoff 
-- value for determining statistical significance is ultimately decided on by 
-- the researcher, but usually a value of .05 or less is chosen. This 
-- corresponds to a 5% (or less) chance of obtaining a result like the one 
-- that was observed if the null hypothesis was true.

-- On the meaning of the p-value https://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/p_values.htm:
-- "If your P value is less than the chosen significance level then you reject 
-- the null hypothesis i.e. accept that your sample gives reasonable evidence 
-- to support the alternative hypothesis."
-- => because we want to return (Just True) for our t-tests in case the test 
-- accepts the null hypothesis, we need to check if the computed p value is
-- larger than the significance level (alpha)

-- MORE ON THE MEANING OF the p-value:
--     A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the 
--        null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

--     A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null 
--        hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
